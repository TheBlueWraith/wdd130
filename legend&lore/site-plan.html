      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>This is an organizational website for all the information I have for my D&D campaign- My current idea is a main page that depicts the 7 planets of the universe I have made, and each of them is a button that leads to a child page with all the information organized in sections that drop down to show the informative text. </p>

        <p>The main page will also have information about the universe as a whole, along with the two major gods (each planet was created and is presided over by a smaller god, all of whom are children of the main two). </p>
        
        <p>I'd even be interested to add some sort of animation to the planets- some sort of shift/expansion when they are hovered over, maybe? And the first two planets orbit around each other, so if it's possible to get something like that to work, that'd be super cool to learn+make happen. </p>
        
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Honestly, my audience is myself. I need a way to organize all my work, and just having piles of google docs isn't cutting it.</p>

        <p> (story) Before everything, there were two. Two forces, two Beings, two lovers. Light loved Void, and Void loved Light. In the middle where they met became a creation point- brightness and shadow bound by love into new beings. Colours were now in the world, shimmering between the forces and creating power all their own. First came Yellow, the eldest and the strongest. Next was the Blue, the creator and protector of our world. Red and Orange came at once, spiralling around each other and burning hot. Next came Green, strange and chaotic; then Indigo, cold and harsh. The final child is Violet, often forgotten and closest to her father, Void. The Colours all grew and learned in an era without time or contrast, constantly surrounded by both Light and Void. Eventually the two Beings decided that it was time for the Colours to learn more than they could in this grey space and gave to each of them the power to create for themselves. Each Colour created a planet or plane, hanging in the new space between Light and Void. The first were Red and Orange, who created identical planets and set them in orbit around each other, then sent these gyroscoping spheres in a constant circle around their mother, Light. They divided each planet in two, placing upon each two elemental planes. Red presides over Earth and Air, while Orange watches Water and Fire. Yellow followed after, creating not a physical planet but a divine meetingplace where all the Colours may meet. This shining plane also serves as a barrier, protecting the planets to come from the volatile power of the elements, as well as housing the intersection of Light and Void (titled the Penumbra), from which flows the Chromatic power. The next planet is that of Green, coursing with divine power due to its proximity to Yellow’s plane and the Penumbra. Green created the first humanoids, new and strange in their consciousness. Fae creatures populate this planet, walking the line between human and creature.  The next planet of the Chromastan was created by the Blue and is our home. The Blue formed all the races on this planet, desiring a greater variety than even Green had created. There is less strange magic here, as it is further from Yellow’s plane. After the Blue completed their planet, Indigo created hers. Even further from Light and from the Penumbra, Indigo's people live in mundanity and darkness, ever overshadowed by Void. The final planet, that of Violet, is cold and dark, holding naught but ethereal figures nigh-untouched by Light. </p>
        <p>Any divine power granted by a planet's deity is strongest on the planet associated with that deity. Planeshifting is dangerous for those followers, as they may not have enough power to return [The game mechanic for this is that they lose their two highest spell levels when they leave their planet. Following a deity of a planet not your own is possible, highly looked down on in society and is so much weaker that it's not really worth it. It is also harder to get those powers, since there's both the physical distance and at least one other deity's influence in the way, it's really hard to make a sufficiently close relationship with a deity from a different planet. On any planet, however, people can follow Light and/or Void. This will mean a less personal relationship with your deity, but some people find it worth it to have power that maintains strength throughout the universe.</p>
        <p> (Light) Light is brash and confident, perpetually grinning happily at everything around her. She pushes her children to become the best they can be, supporting them in new endeavours and offering advice frequently. Her planetary supplicants often pray to her with a desire to recieve answers or make a difficult decision, trusting her to direct them towards the best path for their lives. Light, though warming and generous, is also present in the core of a searing flame and the sheen on the exacting cut of a butcher's knife. </p>
        <p> (Void) Void is quieter, taking his time to watch what goes on around him before reacting. He holds his children close when he can and supports them from a distance when he cannot. Supplicants to him on the planets often find comfort in praying to him, as Void, though dark and unknowable, is also present in the peace of midnight's darkness and the protection of a child's blanket, pulled over their head to hide from the monsters. </p>

      <h3>Red</h3>
          <p> (Will be expanded later) Red (she/her) holds the dual elemental planes of air and earth, while Orange (he/him) watches over Fire and Water. (It is ironic how that worked out, because Red's personality is much more dramatic than Orange, so one would think that Red would hold the more volatile elemental planes.) </p>
          <p>Red and Orange's planets actually circle each other in their circuit around the sun.</p>

      <h3>Orange</h3>
        <p> (Will be expanded later) Red (she/her) holds the dual elemental planes of air and earth, while Orange (he/him) watches over Fire and Water.

      <h3>Yellow</h3>
        <p> (Will be expanded+updated later) Yellow's domain is less of a real 'planet' and serves as more of a meeting space for the deities when they need it. This does not occur often, however, as the sudden disappearance of divine power from the planets tends to end in crisis. If a mortal manages to get there without being lost (physically or mentally) they become a demideity and are given a moon to guard and influence a planet with. Also serves as a sort of wall between the 'peopled' planes and the elementals. </p>
        <p> Yellow followed after, creating not a physical planet but a divine meetingplace where all the Colours may meet. This shining plane also serves as a barrier, protecting the planets to come from the volatile power of the elements, as well as housing the intersection of Light and Void (titled the Penumbra), from which flows the Chromatic power. </p>
        <p>This is also the afterlife (add more info about it)</p>

      <h3>Green</h3>
        <p>The next planet is that of the Green, coursing with divine power due to its proximity to Yellow’s plane and the Penumbra. Green created the first humanoids, new and strange in their consciousness. Fae beings populate this planet, walking the line between human and creature. </p>
        <p> Green's (ze/zir) planet is this universe’s equivalent of the Feywild- it is a mirror of the material plane that sits between it and extreme sources of power (such as Yellow’s plane), and as such, things there are similar to the planet of the Blue, but stronger and stranger.</p>
        
        <p>Images for Green</p>
          <img src="#" alt="image for page3">
        
      <h3>Blue</h3>
        <p>(There will be more. So, so much more.) The Blue's(they/them) planet is where our story begins (it is the equivalent of the Material Plane), and the tale will stay there a while, since there is no mundane interplanetary travel yet (plane shift spells work, though they vary in difficulty depending on the desired destination). Blue themselves are actually two beings in one: Legend and Lore were born as conjoined twins, and when there was an attempt to divide them, the first black hole was created. They were quickly reconnected and the black hole faded, though there is still a scar in space.</p>
        <p>(Deity)The Blue is the main deity for this campaign, and having lived on their planet, players will know their story. (Much like we know the creation/workings of our Earth, characters would have been taught the story of the Blue.) The Blue is a creature of opposites. Each half takes after a parent- so one side is of Light, and the other of Void. They use they/them pronouns when together (since they're...y'know...plural in that case), but even when referring to only one side, mortals use they/them pronouns, despite their divided gender presentations (Legend is the light side and presents masculinely, and Lore is the void side who presents more femininely). Since the two spend so much all their time together, often even sharing minds, society's line between genders is nothing to them. They must always remain connected, but can change their connection point depending on what activities they are doing. If they need use of their hands, for example, they may shift the connection point to their hip or knee so they can stand next to each other and work. For walking, it is usually as though they are holding hands. When sleeping, however, they cannot focus on maintaining a new connection point and therefore share a mind, as they were born. This means that they dream together and often share thoughts intentionally to consider. This mental connection is also chosen when there is something of great power or import that needs to be completed. Since the crisis after their first attempted division, it has been obvious that the two cannot be split. Due to this, they were given a planet to share. They couldn't decide on a singular intelligent species to populate it with, therefore multiple species are present thereon. There are two moons orbiting this planet- a singular pair of twins succeeded many years ago in reaching Yellow's realm, and were therefore given moons of their own. As such, the tides move 4x a day, rather than 2x, and there is always a moon in the sky regardless of the time of day (you can only see both on rare occasions at the very lip of dawn or dusk). Legend speaks directly with mortals most frequently, but Lore is more often influencing things to help people subtly.</p>

      <h3>Indigo</h3>
        <p>(Will be expanded later) Indigo is the equivalent of the Shadowfell, which is also a mirror of the Material plane, but further from Light's power, and is therefore cold and plain. There is little to no magic to speak of there, and the population is constantly at war with each other.</p>
        <p>Even further from Light and from the Penumbra, Indigo's people live in mundanity and darkness, ever overshadowed by Void.</p>

      <h3>Violet</h3>
        <p>The final planet, that of Violet, is cold and dark, holding naught but ethereal figures nigh-untouched by Light.</p>
        <p>Violet (she/her) is somewhat separated from the other planets, the child most frequently forgotten in stories and tales. She's happy though- being further from Light means that she is closer to Void, and she has always been a ‘Daddy's girl’. Violet is the equivalent of the Ethereal Plane: since there is so little Light, things are much less corporeal than any of the other planets. </p>

      <h3>Secret Page</h3>
        <p>The Forsaker is the influence of imbalance in the world, the opposite of what the Blue tries to do (and is totally unknown by the citizens of the planet). The Cut is a random occurrence, with no limits or pattern to its victims, where someone’s morals and goodness is suddenly stripped from them with no cause or cure. No one on the planet knows the source, either- there have been studies done that prove it is not divine magic. (One of the few direct influences on the planet of the Blue from The Forsaker, the Cut divides people’s minds in two, the light from the dark. Without this essential, balanced intermingling, the person is driven mad and begins to do actions that are completely opposite of their usual actions. There are bad people who have been hit by the Cut who were then turned forevermore towards good, but that is rarely of note so people mostly think of it as only happening to good people and turning them bad.)</p>
