            <h1>The History of the CHROMASTAN</h1> 
            <p>Before everything, there were two. Two forces, two Beings, two lovers. Light loved Void, and Void loved Light. In the middle where they met became a creation point- brightness and shadow bound by love into new beings. Colours were now in the world, shimmering between the forces and creating power all their own. First came <a href=subpages\yellow.html style="color:#efe231; text-decoration:none">Yellow</a>, the eldest and the strongest. Next was the <a href=subpages\blue.html style="color:#3f04ff; text-decoration:none">Blue</a>, balanced and cooperative. <a href=subpages\red.html style="color:#bc241d; text-decoration:none">Red</a> and <a href=subpages\orange.html style="color:#ee6f00; text-decoration:none">Orange</a> came at once, spiralling around each other and searing with power. Next came <a href=subpages\green.html style="color:#288d1a; text-decoration:none">Green</a>, strange and chaotic; then <a href=subpages\indigo.html style="color:#890ffb; text-decoration:none">Indigo</a>, cold and harsh. The final child is <a href=subpages\violet.html style="color:#d77ee7; text-decoration:none">Violet</a>, youngest and closest to her father, Void. The Colours all grew and learned in an era without time or contrast, constantly surrounded by both Light and Void. Eventually the two Beings decided that it was time for the Colours to learn more than they could in this grey space and gave to each of them the power to create for themselves. Each Colour created a planet or plane, hanging in the new space between Light and Void. The first were <a href=subpages\red.html style="color:#bc241d; text-decoration:none">Red</a> and <a href=subpages\orange.html style="color:#ee6f00; text-decoration:none">Orange</a>, who created identical planets and set them in orbit around each other, then sent these gyroscoping spheres in a constant circle around their mother, Light. They divided each planet in two, placing upon each two elemental planes. <a href=subpages\red.html style="color:#bc241d; text-decoration:none">Red</a> presides over Earth and Air, while <a href=subpages\orange.html style="color:#ee6f00; text-decoration:none">Orange</a> watches Water and Fire. <a href=subpages\yellow.html style="color:#efe231; text-decoration:none">Yellow</a> followed after, creating not a physical planet but a divine meetingplace where all the Colours may meet. This shining plane also serves as a barrier, protecting the planets to come from the volatile power of the elements, as well as housing the intersection of Light and Void (titled the Penumbra), from which flows the Chromatic power. The next planet is that of <a href=subpages\green.html style="color:#288d1a; text-decoration:none">Green</a>, coursing with divine power due to its proximity to <a href=subpages\yellow.html style="color:#efe231; text-decoration:none">Yellow</a>’s plane and the Penumbra. <a href=subpages\green.html style="color:#288d1a; text-decoration:none">Green</a> created the first humanoids, new and strange in their consciousness. Fae creatures populate this planet, walking the line between human and creature. The next planet of the Chromastan was created by the <a href=subpages\blue.html style="color:#3f04ff; text-decoration:none">Blue</a>. They formed all the races on their planet, desiring a greater variety than even Green had created. There is less strange magic here, as it is further from <a href=subpages\yellow.html style="color:#efe231; text-decoration:none">Yellow</a>’s plane. After the <a href=subpages\blue.html style="color:#3f04ff; text-decoration:none">Blue</a> completed their planet, <a href=subpages\indigo.html style="color:#890ffb; text-decoration:none">Indigo</a> created theirs. Even further from Light and from the Penumbra, <a href=subpages\indigo.html style="color:#890ffb; text-decoration:none">Indigo</a>'s people live in mundanity and darkness, ever overshadowed by Void. The final planet, that of <a href=subpages\violet.html style="color:#d77ee7; text-decoration:none">Violet</a>, is cold and dark, holding naught but ethereal figures nigh-untouched by Light. </p>
            <p>Any divine power granted by a planet's deity is strongest on the planet associated with that deity. Planeshifting is dangerous for those followers, as they may not have enough power to return. Following a deity of a planet not your own is possible, but it is looked down on in society and any power is so much weaker that it's not really worth it. It is also harder to get those powers: since there is both the physical distance and at least one other deity's influence in the way, it's really hard to make a sufficiently close relationship with a deity from a different planet. On any planet, however, people can follow Light and/or Void. This will mean a less personal relationship between the worshipper and their deity, but some people find it worth it to have power that maintains strength throughout the universe.</p>
            <p>GAME INFLUENCE: Followers of a god not associated with the planet upon which they reside do not have access to their highest spell level. They have the slots, but cannot cast that level. </p>

        <div id="void"> 
            <h1>VOID</h1>
            <p>Void is quiet, taking his time to watch what goes on around him before reacting. He holds his children close when he can and supports them from a distance when he cannot. Supplicants to him on the planets often find comfort in praying to him since Void, though dark and unknowable, is also present in the peace of midnight's darkness and the protection of a child's blanket, pulled over their head to hide from the monsters.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="light"> 
            <h1>LIGHT</h1>
            <p>Light is brash and confident, perpetually grinning happily at everything around her. She pushes her children to become the best they can be, supporting them in new endeavours and offering advice frequently. Her planetary supplicants often pray to her with a desire to recieve answers or make a difficult decision, trusting her to direct them towards the best path for their lives. Light, though warming and generous, is also present in the core of a searing flame and the sheen on the exacting cut of a butcher's knife.</p>
