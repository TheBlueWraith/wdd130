    <h1>THE FORSAKER</h1>
    <h3>"So you’ve come in search of truth, have you? You’ve found the right place. I am the Forsaker. I was formed from all that the gods refused to see, and I continue to hold all the truths they refuse to acknowledge. Welcome, and I hope you enjoy comprehension."</h3>

        <h2>Information</h2>
        <p>The Forsaker is right in many ways. He is made of what the gods discarded and forgot, and he does hold sway over many truths that the gods do not like to think about. What he is not telling you, however, is that he is terribly miserable. He emerged from the scrap pile after the Chromaston completed their planets, expecting a family or at least some sort of excitement, only to find himself alone amongst the dross of creation. For all his disdain of the gods, if one were to acknowledge him he would immediately join them. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately for him, none of them ever will. He is the influence of imbalance in the universe, the opposite of what the gods are trying to do. No matter what he tries, any recognition of him or his efforts would prove to be a flaw in any god who did so, so they continue to simply ignore him, cleaning up his messes as best they can. He is also unknown by the citizens of the planets.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="influence">
        <h2>Influence</h2>
        <p>The Forsaker has little direct influence upon the world. He can send nudges or thoughts, but rarely can he touch the exact movements of fate and her strings. One of the few pressures he does have is a phenomenon called the Cut. The Cut is a seemingly random occurrence, with no limits or pattern to its victims.  When it strikes, an individuals' morals are suddenly stripped from them with no cause or cure. No one on the planets knows anything about the source, save for studies done that prove it is not divine magic. What these mortals do not know is that the Cut is the Forsaker’s one tool against the gods and their creations. It divides people’s minds in two, the light from the dark. Without this essential, balanced intermingling, the person breaks and begins to do actions that are completely opposite to their usual actions. For the average person, who is relatively centered between good and evil, the Cut tends to have little visible effect. There may be a shift in personality, often becoming more rude than before (or kinder), but it is typically considered to simply be a natural change in the person. When someone is deeply good or deeply evil, however, the change is far more stark. Oftimes in such circumstances, the sharp change from one side to the other sends the person utterly mad. The most recognized Cuts are when a person of great goodness is hit and becomes a creature of evil. There are also villains who have been hit by the Cut who were then turned forevermore towards good, but the repercussions from that are often quiet, as the villain will simply disappear from the crime scene and lose their nome de plume, then reappear in charitable circles under their real name. Therefore, most people mostly think of the Cut as only happening to good people and turning them bad.</p>
        <p>One of the Forsaker’s biggest projects is his work on the Blue. He has been watching and influencing the royal lines of Duskad and Edrana since their conception, urging disquiet and chaos between the two countries. His influence has even become a legend and curse, causing citizens to believe that their countries can never be at peace one with the other.</p>

        <h2>Forsaken</h2>
        <h4>Dinui Outis</h4>
        <p>This is her story, as written in a book found in a temple to Light and Void. Its origin is unknown to mortals. </p>
        <p>A shattered silver breastplate, still loosely attached to the straps but hanging down to rest upon the ground. Hands limp and cold upon the stone, palms up after dropping the pike scattered across the floor a few feet away. Head slack against the floor, the now-cracked helmet halfway fallen and revealing a pale face, empty in the shadows. </p>
        <p>And a sword. No colder than the rest of the corpse, but viciously sharp as it stands straight, thrust through the ribs into the ground below and left behind as blood seeped from the chest around the blade. No blood is pooled on the stone, though, and no drag marks mar the floor around the body. Pristine obsidian lays beneath the armoured figure, faintly reflecting the metal’s shine. The room is dark save for a slight glow around the figure and a faint hallway. The constant black stone distorts perception and makes the room cavernous and claustrophobic at once. Whispers and breaths shiver through the space, reflecting off each wall and forming an audible fog that muffles any movement or voice that could be heard from down that hall. </p>
        <p>A finger twitches, an involuntary shift as a deep voice cuts through the buzz. </p>
        <p>“Passer of Realms. You have not passed yet.”</p>
        <p>Another finger twitches, then the whole hand. An arm shifts to try and lift the body, halting as eyes open to see the still-standing sword, the handle hovering a metre above your head. There is somehow no sharp pain from the blade, just the constraint of being pinned to the floor and a dull ache across the whole body.</p>
        <p>Another being enters the room, stepping with purpose until they are next to the corpse on the floor. Their hand reaches out, grasping the handle of the sword firmly before pausing, almost debating between removing it or pushing it further through your ribs. </p>
        <p>A sudden dragging pull through the chest, then the sword is removed and thrown to the side, scattering across the stone with a grating sound that silences the whispers. The empty void of sound rings in its own strange way, and every tiny sound reverberates off the stone as you stand. Your helmet remains on the floor, but you have no time to pick it up and, strangely, no desire to. </p>
        <p>The stranger is already walking away, back towards the hallway. There are no footsteps as they walk, but yours echo off the walls as you follow them, sweeping up your pike from the ground  to use as both a comfort and a walking stick. The person walks a few paces ahead, staring straight down the hall towards a distant archway, the door closed but a faint golden light emerging from the cracks around it. </p>
        <p>As the doorway approaches, the person snaps quietly and a rustle floods the hallway. Looking back, the room where you once laid is <i>gone,</i> nothing more than a black void to indicate what may have once been there. When you look back to the doorway the person is gone and the door is now open. Stepping in, your eyes scan the room and take in the obsidian walls and the black chair on the opposite end. There is someone in the seat that looks like no-one and everyone, a muted humanoid with just enough mundanity to make your eyes slide past in search of someone else, someone who must be the real source of the voice you heard. Other than this throne and its vague occupant, however, the room is empty and the walls soar above like the frigid face of a mountain glaring down upon you. </p>
        <p>As you drag your eyes back to the figure, you wonder how you could ever have skimmed past him. His eyes- a coppery brown that you know would look red in some lighting- flash bright as you meet his gaze, and a grin spreads across his face as he sees you watching him. His dark brown hair is slicked back, gelled smooth away from his face, and his tan shirt has fallen open at the top, some few buttons either ignored or left open intentionally. He sits forward and waves you towards him cordially. A nervous shiver runs up your back, but you step forward at his gesture. His eyes stay trained on you as you move closer to him, scanning your face and seeming to see more than he should be able to read from it. </p>
        <p>“You’d like to know who I am.”</p>
        <p>A mute nod, confirming his statement.</p>
        <p>“I am the Forsaker, formed from all that the gods refused to see. I am what gives people their…unique factors, their little quirks and questions.”</p>
        <p>At a face from you, he nods, then speaks again. </p>
        <p>“You’re dead, Dinui.”</p>
        <p>Somehow you knew this, but the blatant way he said it cuts more than the sword he had removed but a few moments– minutes?-- ago. He continues speaking, lightly circling his finger in the air. </p>
        <p>“The manifestation of the sword that I so kindly removed from your soul was a recreation of the blade that took your mortal body.”</p>
        <p>You stare at him, simultaneously disturbed and amazed by his calm demeanour in such a circumstance.</p>
        <p>“I brought you here to make a deal.”</p>
        <p>He stands at this point, stepping down from the small platform to walk around you. He’s taller than you by several inches, and starts making loose, silent circles around you as he speaks. </p>
        <p>“I’d like to see that death counteracted, I really would. I wouldn’t want to lose such a power for…good… in this world.”</p>
        <p>At the word ‘good’, he reaches out to touch the bottom of your jaw, and though in any other circumstance you would have long since hit anyone who acted in such a way towards you, here you feel almost constrained, held by something to prevent any reaction. </p>
        <p>“Unfortunately for the both of us, I need a little something to be able to enact such strong magic. An exchange, if you will. A…contract, even.”</p>
        <p>Here, he stands right in front of you and gazes into your eyes, his own shimmering golden and copper. </p>
        <p>“You really don’t have much to offer, girl. No prospects, no firstborn…Now that, however-”</p>
        <p>He glances up at your forehead, then back to your eyes. </p>
        <p>“You’ve got some memories stored away up there. I could take those for you- it’s not like you’d really be losing anything important, after all. You won’t have to worry about working through bad memories if you don’t have any memories at all. No reminders of betrayal, no thoughts of those you’ve lost and pushed away, no reminders of all your failures, no recollections of dying gruesomely…and you get to go back to the world and continue to simply do what you like. That sounds like a win/win circumstance if I’ve ever heard one.”</p>
        <p>With this, he smirks and steps back.  Spreading his arms, he continues.</p>
        <p>“Well? What do you say?”</p>
        <p>You’re nodding before you can even think, before you even decide to do so. There’s a feeling of a hand on the back of your head, pushing it up and down in a mockery of agreement. The Forsaker’s eyes flash, a bloody gold that spreads and ripples through the room as your eyes roll back in your head. In an instant, what was once an immutable cold turns searing hot, blood rushing through your veins again as your mind empties. Thick liquid pours from your eyes and mouth, flooding down your body and filling the still-gaping sword wound with copper ichor. The metallic surge meets the pieces of shattered armour, pulling them together as though magnetised and seals the sections once more into a cohesive whole, the veins of copper faint as a sigh between the silvered fragments. </p>
        <p>As the armour encloses your body as it did on the day it was made for you, your head falls back as the deluge of copper lessens, then stops entirely. A cold shiver washes across your skin as you stand, the Forsaker simply watching as you stand before him with head lolling back, held more by his own magic than any strength of your own. A final drip of ichor lingers in your eyes like a tear until it finally dissolves.</p>
        <p>A flash of light– no, that must be Light– ripples across your skin, leaving behind it a faint shimmer, hardly visible in the still-reddish glow of the room. The Forsaker looks on with a smirk, watching as the stains of copper on your skin are washed silver with the power of your Goddess, granted as a final desperate attempt to protect you. If you are to return to life by the power of this creature, it will not be without the shield and blessing of the protector to whom you had devoted your life. The Light will do all she can to maintain the balance, even as the Forsaker watches her efforts with a cocky smirk. He takes in one more breath as your eyes finally drift back to a natural position, revealing the faint copper shimmers now embedded in the cool grey. A final word rumbles through the room as the light begins to fade from your vision, your eyelids drifting shut.</p>
        <p>“Excellent.”</p>

        <p>The room is filled with empty beds, sunlight streaming onto them through the tall windows lining the walls. Clerics of Light bustle around the single occupied bed near the back of the room, carrying rags and basins of water to and from. The person laying there has had their armour removed and set to the side, out of the walkway as a new cleric enters the room. They walk quietly but swiftly, their gaze pinned to the body laying still upon the sheets. The other clerics bow their heads in respect and back away, allowing the newcomer to approach the bedside and rest their hand upon the cold arm resting there. Carefully pressing their fingers against the woman’s frigid wrist, they pause for a moment before releasing both a sigh of relief and her wrist, turning to the others to confirm the presence of both heartbeat and soul. It is faint, to be sure, but present nevertheless. From a hitherto-unnoticed basket, they pull out a helmet and settle it on the nightstand next to the bed, watching for another moment to catch sight of another shallow breath. </p>
        <p>They turn to the rest of the crowd, giving instructions for renewing consciousness to the temple’s protector-turned-patient. The bustle begins again as the head cleric settles into the seat next to the bed, beginning a series of ceremonious incantations meant to restore health and vitality to body and mind. Behind them, armour is taken and cleaned, the young cleric taking note of faint veins of copper running through the silver of the original metal but brushing it off as a cosmetic choice.</p>
        <p>The sunlight coming in through the windows has started to fade by the time the head cleric sits back, taking in a deep breath and simply watching for a moment. As they lean back in the chair, they watch with pleasure and grin at the other clerics still present as their patient’s eyes open, slowly focusing on the ceiling above her and picking out details. The head cleric leans forward a little bit to come within her line of sight, then speaks. </p>
        <p>“You’ve had quite an eventful past few days, my friend. How are you feeling, Dinui?”</p>
        <p>She stares back up at them for a moment, seemingly gathering her thoughts before she speaks.</p>
        <p>“Who is Dinui?”</p>
