    <h2>Do the various species of your world each have their own separate cultures or do most/all sapient beings intermingle and share a common way of life?</h2>
    <p>Most frequently they intermingle, especially in larger communities. There are smaller villages that are mostly one species, but they mostly form from family farms that happened to grow to a community, and are therefore not really constructed for other species’ comfort. (Ex: Jethro’s halfling village)</p> 
    <h2>What species or cultures have been extinct or lost to time? Are the fossils, ruins, remnants of things the current age knows about or are they truly a mystery?</h2>
    <p>All the original sapient species are still on the planet, though they have evolved. There are some fossils, etc, but there is not terribly much interest in archaeology. (the few ones there are, however, will tell you that while the species are still technically the same, there has definitely been evolutionary progress within each species and between them! Half-species are still most often infertile, but some have been able to have children and started some new ‘species’.) </p>
    <h2>How is magic viewed by those who don’t use it?</h2>
    <p>Divine magic is pretty common, since the Blue is so closely connected to the planet. Innate magic is generally less seen, but there are a couple magic academies across the lands. </p>
    <h2>How do people get high?</h2>
    <p>Assorted plants and substances that can either be used as-is or refined to get a stronger product. It’s not super popular just for personal use though. The leaves of the Blue’s Trees are also an intoxicant, but are solely reserved for divine practitioners in order to have a closer connection to divinity, especially in times of crisis. </p>
    <h2>What/who are the most common causes of geo-political and/or inter-planar conflict?</h2>
    <p>Duskad and Edrana are pretty frequently at odds over resources. Really, if they just talked it out there’s a simple enough solution, but no one ever wants peace talks.</p>
    <h2>What disease terrifies the population the most?</h2>
    <p>Less a population disease, actually- decades ago, there was a fungus that threatened the Blue’s Trees and that basically sent the world into a panic. They managed to isolate it to prevent it from spreading, but there’s still that constant, faint worry that it will come back and make the Blue leave. </p>
    <h2>Where's the best library in the world, and what's it like?</h2>
    <p> Aclus has a huge population of scholars and artisans, so their capital city is basically one huge library. Every citizen’s front room has shelves filled with books, tools, and art. Everyone is willing to lend, and everyone knows the importance of trust in the academic world. Shared knowledge is so essential that if anyone is found to be taking advantage of this system, they are removed from the city and not allowed to return without mounds of paperwork and multiple courses. It’s very rare that anyone returns. (Aclus is also where the monks live/train, with a headquarters in Contrarsi but smaller branches spread across the country.)</p>
    <h2>What is the most common religion (or shared gods of a universal pantheon) in your world?</h2>
    <p>Naturally the most revered deities are the Blue, Light, and Void. Most people tend to follow the Blue, since they are the closest to this world. The deities of other planets are also known about and respected, but almost no one truly worships them here. </p>
    <h2>Who is the most strange villager in the most weird village in the most weird kingdom?</h2>
    <p>Honestly, that depends on one’s opinion of what is considered ‘weird’. The majority of the population, however, considers Ospya to be the strangest due to the high population of druids. While druids do exist in other countries, they are much rarer and therefore have little influence on the government and population as a whole. In Ospya, however, almost everyone is a druid and those who are not still hold nature in a similarly high esteem. There is a small village, very divided from other communities, where they are fixated on snakes. They do not speak common, but instead a language based on hisses and body movements. Clothing is made to look like the smooth scales of snakes, clinging close to the body. In that village is their leader- called the Fang, which is rather thematic- and he spends so little time with humans that he has forgotten most of how to even be one. This is why he is the leader- for he is halfway between human and snake.</p>
    <h2>What kind of legendary thieves are rumoured to be about?</h2>
    <p>The top tier of Dagik’s crew have performed heists that no one would believe, if there wasn’t indisputable proof. No one even knows who they are under the masks, and the only reason we have a clue who they are is because they left a card. They broke into the Vault of Duskad’s royalty and the Study Room in the capital of Aclus, to start the list. </p>
    <h2>Are there any civilisations that are trying to get by in highly hostile areas? (hostile weather, monsters, etc)</h2>
    <p>There are always a few people who choose to live in strange places. There is at least one community in the Frozen North, and a few communities in the deserts of Ospya. The ocean is also pretty dangerous, but there are communities of water-dwellers (sea elves, merpeople, ocean dragonborn) in the upper quarter of the waters. </p>
    <h2>Are there any underdeveloped civilizations that are not caught up with the modern technology that your world has? Any that are too hostile? Or are there underground/magically invisible countries, maybe to hide from said hostile civilizations?</h2>
    <p>Not really- all citizens at least know of new technology, and when they have enough money they may be able to get it. Communication between communities is pretty important, so no one is really divided from the world. </p>
    <h2>How many dragons are there?</h2>
    <p>A lot, including all maturity levels. (as for ancient ones, there’s about 10) They are pretty nonthreatening to people, though, unless something out of the ordinary occurs. Mostly, they’re just like any large predator- don’t draw their ire, and they’ll leave you alone. They tend to live in locations too inhospitable for regular persons, so there’s rarely interaction (at least in person. Some of the dragons like to write to the Library and request books to entertain themselves, and that keeps a pretty friendly relationship between Aclus and the dragons.) Types: frost, ocean, sand, cloud, magma </p>
    <h2>Who is the most dangerous person alive?</h2>
    <p>This depends on whether you mean actual danger, or potential danger. If it’s potential, then Mbah Kabeya , the druid leader, has a terrifying amount of power, and if they were to ever go rogue, the world as we know it would absolutely end. Actual danger, however, is likely to be Dagik. His threads spread into every country and he can and will find anyone and do anything. </p>
    <h2>What would it take to overthrow/topple the strongest institutions of your world? (Any kind: historical, political, social, religious)</h2>
    <p>Duskad: a proper populus revolt, but they like their royalty too much to dethrone them. Aclus: I think any sort of destruction of knowledge would be enough to send the entire country into chaos. Edrana: same as Duskad. Ospya: some widespread extinction event, maybe? Druids are pretty resilient. </p>
    <h2>What are some notable means of locomotion/travel?</h2>
    <p>The druids actually have this vine-based high-speed transit, which is based in the capital and has branches (lol) that spread across the country. Duskad also has water-based transit (think canals instead of streets and everyone wears clothes that are water-ready)</p>
    <h2>What's the deepest point in the world?</h2>
    <p>The ocean dragons’ community has tunnels spiralling down thousands of metres below sea level. </p>
    <h2>What's the highest point in the world?</h2>
    <p>Edrana has three mountains that make a straight line, gradually increasing in height. The tallest is the head of the ridge that divides Edrana from the Frozen North. </p>
    <h2>Which country is the "France to the rest of the European countries" of your world? (IE: What is the most arrogant nation?)</h2>
    <p>Absolutely Aclus. Everyone else thinks their focus on knowledge is just snobbery. </p>
    <h2> What is the most far off/unexplored land in your world? What keeps it that way?</h2>
    <p>The Frozen North- both the weather and respect for the dragons’ community prevents exploration. </p>
    <h2>What is the event that created the "year 0" of the current calendar?</h2>
    <p>The system used right now counts from the last huge calamity- aka, since the last time the Blue tried to separate. Current year: 1746 AS (After Split). (Something like the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs- mass extinction event, the world basically had to be reformed.)</p>
    <h2>What is a historical event that seems too crazy to be true?</h2>
    <p>The concurrent births of the current heirs of Duskad and Edrana. Same day, same hour- one born in darkness, the other in light because they were so far away from each other. </p>
    <h2>Why is there evil in your world?</h2>
    <p>Greed, The Forsaker, and the Cut. Greed keeps people from becoming equals and thereby prevents utopia. The Forsaker is the influence of imbalance in the world, the opposite of what the Blue tries to do (and is totally unknown by the citizens of the planet). The Cut is a random occurrence, with no limits or pattern to its victims, where someone’s morals and goodness is suddenly stripped from them with no cause or cure. No one on the planet knows the source, either- there have been studies done that prove it is not divine magic. (One of the few direct influences on the planet of the Blue from The Forsaker, the Cut divides people’s minds in two, the light from the dark. Without this essential balanced intermingling, the person is driven mad and begins to do actions that are opposite of their usual actions. There are bad people who have been hit by the Cut who are then turned forever more towards good, but that is rarely of note so people mostly think of it as only happening to good people and turning them bad.)</p>
    <h2>What is the most recent state?</h2>
    <p>Edrana, technically, though only by a few decades. Before that, it was Duskad. </p>
    <h2>What is the thing that comes closest to a literal "nuclear option"? If there is none, is someone working toward it?</h2>
    <p>Actually, anyone intelligent enough to work on such a thing is working to prevent it. If the Cut were to hit someone with enormous power, such as Mbah Kabeya or Dagik, that would be a cataclysmic event. </p>
    <h2>What city do rich people like to live in/visit?</h2>
    <p>It depends on their personal views, though usually those with large sums of money enjoy the capitals and surrounding large cities the most. </p>
    <h2>What are/is the name of the biggest criminal organisation(s)? Do they have any major rivals?</h2>
    <p>Dagik’s organisation, The Family, has threads everywhere. There are a couple smaller groups who would fain take over those connections, but none have even attempted a coup yet. (which is probably for the better- they would be crushed.)</p>
    <h2>What is the richest kingdom? Which is the most populous? What is the most influential race?</h2>
    <p>By money, Edrana technically has the most. If we include assets, then Aclus has great stock of riches within their books, many of which are rare and expensive versions. The most populous is Ospya, mostly by way of how bloody large it is. The most influential race varies, depending on where you go. </p>
    <h2>Can people be revived from the dead without necromancy?</h2>
    <p>Yes. Necromancy does occur, but most people have hardly even heard stories about it, much less seen an undead person. </p>
    <h2>What/When was the last natural disaster to happen?</h2>
    <p>There was a flood in Duskad about 12 years ago. Luckily, restoration went fairly well, Edrana even stepping in to lend a hand.</p>
    <h2>What was the greatest feat of magic in history?</h2>
    <p>No one knows for certain, but it’s rumoured that over a thousand years ago, one of the first druid leaders grew the entire capitol by himself, in a week’s time. All the hometrees are still strong and grow with the population. (DM note: this rumour is true) </p>
    <h2>Which kingdom/country is known to be the best seafaring one? What is their secret?</h2>
    <p>Ironically, not Duskad. Edrana does the best on the oceans, whereas Duskad tends to stick to smaller bodies of water. There’s no secret, really, it’s just that Aclus and Ospya tend to focus on magic for long distance travel so they haven’t put any effort into forming any sort of ocean force. </p>
    <h2>What country is the granary of the world?</h2>
    <p>Aclus. Fields roll between the smaller cities. </p>
    <h2>Do countries have professional armies? Why or why not?</h2>
    <p>Not exactly ‘professional’ armies, though the larger cities keep a standing guard. Duskad and Edrana have (only somewhat condoned) roving bands of ‘soldiers’ that do raids on the other kingdom to try and take land. </p>
    <h2>What is the Atlantis/El Dorado of your world?</h2>
    <p>There are rumours of a community somewhere at the bottom of the Sand dragons’ tunnels where they keep mounds of treasures- what sort of treasures varies depending on who you ask. People from Aclus will tell you it's a huge, lost library, and people from Edrana will say its gold farther than the eye can see. </p>
    <h2>Where does magic come from?</h2>
    <p>There is both divine and inherent magic. Most is divine based though, inherent is pretty rare. </p>
    <h2>What is a custom that's considered good manners despite being impolite IRL?</h2>
    <p>Doing things twice over when it only needs one- it’s annoying/redundant IRL but in world it’s respectful to the Blue. </p>
    <h2>What is the view of gender on the Blue?</h2>
    <p>Since the Blue is nonbinary, people outside the binary (especially those who use they/them pronouns like the Blue) are seen as just a bit cooler than everyone else. It’s no REAL status boost, it’s just a cool thing.</p>
