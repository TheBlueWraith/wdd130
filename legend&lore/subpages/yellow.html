            <p>Yellow's domain is less of a real 'planet' and is more of a demiplane- still physically connected to the realism overseen by the rest of the Chromastan, but mostly serves as a meeting space for the deities when they need it. This does not occur often, however, as the sudden disappearance of divine power from the planets tends to end in crisis. If a mortal manages to get there without being lost (physically or mentally) they become a demigod due to their proximity to the Penumbra and are offered a moon to guard and influence a planet with. If they turn this down, they are offered knowledge (though they must ask the questions to receive answers, Yellow does not choose what information to offer.)</p>
            <p> Yellow’s plane does not have physical mass as such, only existing as much as Yellow wills it. They can form it in whatever shape pleases them, changing to fit their mood or intent with naught but a thought. Oftentimes when they have visitors, Yellow will adjust the visual representation of their plane to fit either the person’s expectation or their homeworld, depending on how they wish the interaction to proceed. </p>
            <p>This shining plane also serves as a barrier between the volatile elemental planes and the mortals on the other side, as well as housing the Penumbra (intersection of Light and Void), the source of deific Chromatic power.</p>
