            <p>The Blue are actually two beings in one: Legend and Lore were born as conjoined twins, and when there was an attempt to divide them, the first black hole was created. They were quickly reconnected and the black hole faded, though there is still a scar in space. Children are taught the story of the Blue as part of history class in school.</p>
            <p>The Blue is a creature of opposites and balance. Each twin takes after a parent- so one is of Light, and the other of Void. They use they/them pronouns when together (since they're plural in that case), but even when referring to only one side, they still use they/them pronouns despite the divided gender presentations. Legend is the light side and presents masculinely, and Lore is the void side and presents more femininely. Since the two spend all their time together, often even sharing minds, society's line between genders is nothing to them. They must remain conjoined, but can change their connection point depending on what activities they are doing. If they need use of their hands, for example, they may shift the connection point to their hip or knee so they can stand next to each other and work. For walking, it is usually as though they are holding hands. When sleeping, however, they cannot focus on maintaining a new connection point and therefore share a mind, as they were born. This means that they dream together and, when awake, can share thoughts intentionally so both can consider an issue at once. This mental connection is often chosen when there is something of great power/import that needs completed. </p>
            <p>Obviously the two cannot be split, so they were given a planet to share. They couldn't decide on a singular intelligent species to populate it with, therefore multiple species are present thereon. (For gameplay purposes, this means that any living race may be chosen.)</p>
            <p>There are two moons orbiting this planet- a singular pair of twins succeeded in reaching Yellow's realm and were therefore given moons of their own. As such, the tides move 4x a day, rather than 2x, and there is always a moon in the sky regardless of the time of day (you can only see both on rare occasions at the very lip of dawn or dusk)</p>
            <p>Legend interacts directly most frequently with mortals, but Lore is more often influencing things to help people subtly.</p>
            <p>Their perpetual connection and the calamity caused by any separation has even inspired a children’s game, where they try to do tasks without letting go of each other.</p>

            <h2>Countries</h2>
            
            <h3>Aclus</h3>
            <p>Capital City: Contrarsi</p>
            <p>Governing System: Representative Democracy</p>
            <p>Aclus has a huge population of scholars and artisans, so Contrarsi is basically one huge library. Every citizen’s front room has shelves filled with books, tools, and art. Everyone is willing to lend, and everyone knows the importance of trust in the academic world. Shared knowledge is so essential that if anyone is found to be taking advantage of this system, they are removed from the city and not allowed to return without mounds of paperwork and multiple courses. It’s very rare that anyone returns. Aclus is also the main country where the monks live/train, with a headquarters in Contrarsi but smaller branches spread across the country, then even fewer spread across the world.</p>
            <p>Aclus is mostly plains biome, meaning it is the 'bread basket' of the Blue, growing a large portion of the grains and other plants required.</p> 
            <p>The location of highest importance is the Study Room, where the rarest and the most dangerous texts are held. Anyone is technically allowed to visit, but to be admitted and have access to the books, citizens must complete a long set of courses on the treatment of such artifacts and multiple humanities courses in order to prevent damage to the texts and to dissuade usage of the extremely powerful magics contained in that room. For the books that are mundane, but very rare, there are copies of the words published so people can read them without needing to undergo the courses, it is just the specific rare publications that require extra preparation.</p>
            
            <h3>Duskad</h3>
            <p>Capital city: Trouveh</p>
            <p>Governing System: Monarchy</p>
            <p>Duskad at odds with Edrana for resources- they could get along if they had peace talks, but every time they’ve tried, something has gone wrong. Whether it’s one of the leaders choosing not to parley, a natural disaster at the intended meeting place, or some other chaos, nothing ever works. Their main trade is carving/boatmaking/other wood products, so they always need wood, which is sourced mostly from Edrana. The land used to be one large mass, but when the Divide happened, an impact shattered the continent.</p>
            <p>Duskad is mostly water biome, varying between bogs/swamps, cities filled with canals instead of roads, and small islands scattered into the ocean. As you head inland, the water slowly transitions from the salt of the ocean water to fresh, meaning that many islands near the ‘coast’ are surrounded by a strange brackish mixture.</p>  
            <p>The most protected location in the country is The Vault, owned by the royal family. It contains not only riches but magical items. One of these is the Crown, which determines the divinely-appointed ruler when it is uncertain and is also used for coronations.</p>
            
            <h3>Edrana</h3>
            <p>Capital city: Verloren</p>
            <p>Governing System: Monarchy</p>
            <p>At odds with Duskad for resources, specifically foodstuffs that are impossible to find in the forests and for population. The two countries could get along if they had peace talks, but every time they’ve tried, something has gone wrong.</p>
            <p>Edrana is mostly composed of a forest biome.</p>
            <p>Securest location is a temple of the Blue, which holds a magical artifact with the same powers as the Crown, but it is much more secret and used with much less frequency.</p>
            
            <h3>Frozen North</h3>
            <p>Capital City: Palna (by default, as it is the only non-dragon settlement.)</p>
            <p>There is no government save for the loose hierarchy of the community, based on experience.</p>
            <p>It’s just what it sounds like: cold, ice, and nothing even remotely resembling hospitality. Palna is about 5 days’ travel from the edge of the country, and they stay pretty solitary.</p>
            
            <h3>Ospya</h3>
            <p> Capital city: Gabesh</p>
            <p>Governing System: Democratic</p>
            <p>The majority of the world’s population considers Ospya to be the strangest due to the high population of druids. While druids do exist in other countries, they are much rarer and therefore have little influence on the government and population as a whole. In Ospya, however, almost everyone is a druid and even those who are not still hold nature in great esteem. The capital is made of giant, hollow trees that form the buildings-- everything from homes to government buildings to stores is built within the bark and branches of these huge trees. It also has a high-speed, vine-based public transit system that has branches spreading through the country to the other major cities.</p>
            <p>All the biomes are represented across the country.</p> 
            <p>The most secure location on Ospya is in Gabesh, where a sealed tree in the main governing building secretly holds items of great importance or danger. </p>
            
            <h2>Oceans</h2> 
            <p>The unclaimed portions of the oceans are split between the countries, jurisdiction depending on which country you are closest to. Due to the presence of dragons in the oceans, however, there is usually little crime past petty things that the individual leaders of communities can handle. The dragons, merpeople, and sea elves each have their large portions of loosely claimed territory, and they each overlaps with the others. Travel does not happen frequently directly across the Ocean, but when it does occur it is with the express permission of the people whose territory is being crossed. </p>
            
            <h2>Time System</h2>
            <p>7 day weeks with 24 hour days. It is described, however, based on the moons rather than weeks or months. A quarter moons phase is equivalent to a week, and since there are two moons, one is always visible (even during the day) to allow knowledge of what phase it is.</p>
            
            <h2>The Family</h2>
                <p>Dagik is the one the world sees, a guy who is pretty intelligent and certainly cunning enough to get people to join him. The real planner, however, is his partner- both in crime and life. Adair runs the plans and coordinates things, handles all communications (only by written word to maintain the illusion of Dagik’s seniority, and she’s been doing this the whole time so there’s no variance in the handwriting), and is basically the entire structure of the Family. Dagik’s family forms the core of the organisation, and from thence rose the tradition of calling fellow members ‘cousin’. The leaders of the different headquarters are called Mother or Father by those from that branch, and Aunt or Uncle by members from other branches. 
                <p>The Family has fingers in many pies, including mercenary work, smuggling, and black markets across the world. It does not get mixed up with drugs or any sort of genocide. All the governments know about the Family and the presence in their city. They also know, however, that crime is inescapable and it’s better to have an organised crime family with morals than just swathes of unorganised and random criminals. The Family keeps worse groups from gaining strength, wiping out or integrating competition before they can become a real threat.</p>
                
                <p>Headquarters (AKA “Home”): located in Contrarsi, Aclus for access to information</p>
                <p>Smaller headquarters in each capital, watched over by other members of the top tier. Ospya: Sheffield, Edrana: Bernard, Duskad: Jeshua.</p>
                <p>There are two representatives in the Frozen North, but little happens there that is of interest. The permanent partner, Gillebrìde, is a frost dragonborn that started at Home but the warm temperatures were so detrimental to her health that she needed to be elsewhere. Adair saw this as the perfect opportunity to fill the void in their operations, and sent Gillebrìde with another member to watch over Palna. There is a rotating cycle of members that help Gillebrìde, but none of them do well with the environment so they cycle through, with one per season. </p>
                
                <p>Basically any community large enough to be called a ‘city’ has at least one Cousin there.</p>
                
                <p>The symbol is a broken stump, the roots still spreading. Rather than this being a threat against the Blue, this is instead a statement that even when visible efforts and religion have failed, the roots will still be strong and hold the world upright.</p>
                
                <h3>Notable Members:</h3>
                <p>Adair: silver art deco beaded dress. HOT AF. ‘stately’? On a grander scale than Dagik but somehow still on his arm, rather than he on hers. Dark brown hair in curls, about chin length. Styled with finger waves in the front to keep it out of the face, a silvery barrette/clip above the ear, then just the natural curls in the back. Silver bangles (among them is the one that serves as her arcane focus).</p>
                <p>She uses ‘animate objects” in her office so her furniture will shift to more comfortable positions (being tall is *rough*) and she keeps an extra empty side table in the room so it can run around and grab things she needs (it has filigree vines that stick up around the top so it can grab things). Find Familiar: she has a little sheep!!! Illik is such a good girl. (fey). She has cast “Magical Aura” on most of her items, so any divination spells will make her seem completely mundane) </p>
                <p>Each of her bangles holds a spell component, either incorporated into the metal or as an inset:</p>
                <p>Dancing lights: Wychwood (wooden beads secured in place on a silver hoop)</p>
                <p>Mending: Two Lodestones (set into the metal on opposite sides, keeping it balanced)</p>
                <p>Message: Copper wire (bangle spiralled with one strand of silver and one of copper)</p>
                <p>Alarm:A piece of silver wire and a small silver bell (a thin bangle with a bell bead on it)</p>
                <p>Comprehend Languages: soot and salt (tiny domes in settings like jewels, but when you look closely, the soot and salt can move freely within the glass.</p>
                <p>Feather Fall: a small feather (This one doesn’t look like an actual feather, but the silver filigree feather set onto one of the bangles was actually formed from the ashes of feathers)</p>
                <p>Identify: a pearl and an owl feather (similar feather technique to the other, except that this one is a charm that curls around the pearl) </p>
                <p>Mage Armour: A piece of cured leather (Not a bangle, actually: this one is her garters, made from kid leather)</p>
                <p>Tenser’s Floating Disk: Drop of mercury (this was just added into the molten silver for this bangle)</p>
                <p>Locate Object: a forked twig (this one actually required magic to complete: a forked twig was found and then shrunk, then embedded into the silver.</p>
                <p>Magic Aura: A small square of silk (for this she just carries a handkerchief)</p>
                <p>Rope Trick: powdered corn extract and a twisted loop of parchment (also tiny crystalline domes)</p>
                <p>Tongues: a small clay model of a ziggurat (a tiny charm)</p>
                <p>Arcane Eye: a bit of bat fur (embedded in amber, which is then set like a jewel)</p>
                <p>Private Sanctum: a thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite (the lead is hidden behind the glass, which is set into the silver, and the chrysolite and cotton [kinda looks like the tesseract] are tucked into a crystalline dome which is also set into the silver)</p>
                <p>Secret Chest: the miniature version is a very small charm.</p>
                <p>Telepathic Bond: pieces of eggshell from two different kinds of creatures (set into the silver on opposite sides of the bangle)</p>
                <p>Globe of Invulnerability: crystal bead (she has multiple of these [since they get used up at the end of the spell] and they are set up similarly to the wooden beads)</p>
                
                <p>Dagik: tailcoat (VERY well fitted), with a vest beneath- the vest has embroidered, in silver thread, the same pattern as Adair’s dress.(This vest is actually his armour) On the lapel are small pins in a row: a small ivory door, a marble sphere, and a tiny silver spoon. (There are very small pockets that make up the lining of the coat and hold spell components, but those are invisible to people around him.) Pants are snug but well tailored, silver pinstripes that just barely shimmer in the lamplight. Hair: black but has blue/purple undertones, tied back into a sleek low ponytail with a silver cord/wire (which he uses as a garotte in extreme circumstances). Some short scruff, also black, trimmed sharply to a good shape. Cocky. Pointed teeth. Tan skin, and the ridge of his horns barely grazes the edge of his hairline, creating almost a circlet until they point up a little bit at the crown of his head. Eyes are full black, with a devilish twinkle. ABSOLUTELY wearing silver eyeliner. </p>
                
                <p>Jeshua: Duskad- spends most of his time inside but runs his branch well. He was adopted by an older couple in the Family as a baby- he’s young to be an Uncle (23), but he proved himself as a Cousin and was assigned the responsibility by Dagik.</p>
                
                <p>Sheffield: Ospya. He’s a bit of a druid, in a yeehaw, cowboy way.</p>
                
                <p>Brenard: Edrana. He’s a sweet talker and can integrate himself with the high-level nobles there.</p>

            <p>The Blue is known world-wide as the creator of the planet, but worship varies from person to person. Some believe that the Blue influences every moment and decision made, whereas others consider Them to be distant, more overseers than influences. </p>
            <p>There are temples scattered all across the continents, especially concentrated around the Blue's trees, at least one of which is on every continent. These trees are considered to be the closest contact with deity on the planet, so pilgrimages are not uncommon for those who desire closeness with the Blue or have a difficult decision or request to make. The leaves are used as part of some religious practices, but only the higher-level priests are trained how to safely enter this communicative trance.</p>

            <p>Aspen: Gabesh, druidish citizen (petals)</p>
            <p>(Family) Sheffield: Gabesh. The main Uncle in Ospya, and was assigned there because he’s a bit of a druid himself (in a yeehaw, cowboy way).</p>
            <p>Mbah Kabeya: Loxodon leader of the country. His skin is wrinkled and creases deeply when he smiles, as though he has done so an uncountable number of times. His eyes are glassy black and unseeing, but if you look closely you can see stars in them. It almost looks like a reflection from the open ceiling, but they do not shift like they should. If sufficient attention is paid, people can know that he sees through the stars. His tusks are inlaid with silver, the patterns of the fine filaments halfway between the veins of a leaf and the strands of a spiderweb.</p>

            <p>(Family) Gillebrìde: Palna. Rogue. She’s a frost dragonborn that started at Home but the warm temperatures were so detrimental to her health that she needed to be elsewhere. Adair saw this as the perfect opportunity to fill the void in their operations, and sent Gillebrìde with another member to watch over Palna. There is a rotating cycle of members that help Gillebrìde, but none of them do well with the environment so they cycle through, with one per season.</p>

            <h3>Family Tree </h3>
            <p>Every member of the government knows of the Family. There are specific lessons and pamphlets created for new hires, teaching them about the importance–and danger– of this group of people. They have representatives on every continent, in every country, and every city worth notice. Yet despite the widespread knowledge of them and their huge influence, no government in decades has tried to shut down this criminal organisation. Why? Here is the same answer given to every person who asks that very same question upon first learning about them.</p>
            <p>The Family, as they exist now, has been in place for almost two centuries. Before that, however, they began as a literal family. After being chased from their home for their demon blood, this family of tieflings fell to a life of crime in order to survive. They began smuggling, scraping every penny they could in hopes of providing for themselves again. As they spent more and more time in criminal circles, however, they saw how sharp and biting a life on the streets was for each person. They wondered if, perhaps, there might be a better way. They knew crime could never be eradicated- too many years of governmental failures had proved that- but if it could be organised, there might be a way to provide for such a need while avoiding the suffering of such a lonely life.</p>
            <p>The father of this family (his name is long since scrubbed from any records outside the Family’s own library) began speaking with others he came across, searching out people who might be open to such a plan. He began adopting members into his family, and whenever asked would simply explain the newcomer as one of their ‘cousins’. His own brother, who was with them during the exodus, began making contacts and connections, reliable sources of information and of goods. The mother began learning all she could of fighting and magic, teaching it not only to her husband and brother but also to her children, hoping this knowledge would protect them through the coming storm.</p>
            <p>And come it did- as other crime syndicates started to take notice of this burgeoning criminal family, threats began building against them. Father and Uncle–the whole group now using identifiers as titles– visited with those that threatened, making peace where they could and preventing threat in…other ways when needed. Those that made peace were offered a place in the Family, and many agreed, especially as rumours started to spread about what happened to groups who tried to hurt this Family. What had begun as a simple beg for life started to grow, spreading now across oceans into other countries and making connections with groups everywhere Cousins went. Governments began to take notice and push into Family strongholds, trying to prevent such a power from forming under their noses. Most times, however, they found naught but a letter, left on a table in the centre of the room and sealed with a wax seal depicting a broken stump. Each letter read the same, simply describing the consequences of this threat against their family.</p>
            <p>“You wish the Family to exit your city. We have done so, and hope it brings the results you hope for. We have also distributed word of our exit from your town. It would truly be a shame if that news were to reach the ears of criminals that are…less savoury than ourselves. We wish you luck in your future endeavours- if you wish for a family reunion, simply make it known and we will return.”</p>
            <p>Many governments scoffed at such letters, unworried by their warnings and instead congratulating themselves on having removed such a presence from their city. As days rolled on, however, the Family’s letters proved to be prophetic. What the governing systems had not realised was that the Family have morals. Other criminals do not. What was once a simple smuggling hideout instead became a hive of murderers, kidnappers, and worse. As authority figures watched in horror, these new criminals ravaged their city unlike anything they had seen before. Not only were the original criminals (those who had not joined the Family, at least) returning, but others who were removed from other cities by Family presence were arriving too. Their refusal to join the Family meant that they refused to follow their code (each member of the Family swore to avoid and prevent the worst of crimes)--and were therefore liable to be the worst criminals to be found.</p>
            <p>Inevitably, governing officials swiftly dispersed invitations–begs, really- for a ‘family reunion’. The Family accepted, sending a representative to secretly meet with the head of government in the city and lay down a contract, simply promising not to remove any Family presence from their city. Though many leaders were too frantic to even read the legal terms, Father still wanted to ensure that Family members did not have allowance to run wild and thus added a clause that the above only applied as long as Family members kept to their code. (Many leaders, in reading back over the text later, found themselves thanking him for this mercy.)</p>
            <p>Eventually the original Father stepped down, knowing that he had grown too old to effectively lead the Family anymore. For several years before stepping down, however, he had watched the Cousins to determine which would be the best to fill his role. He eventually decided on his own son who, with almost two decades of training under his belt, was more than qualified to accept the position. So it continued, and eventually enough people knew of them that the Family no longer found themselves threatened with expulsion by the governing systems of the cities they were present in. About every 40 years, the Father (or Mother) watches the Cousins in order to find their successor- the most talented, not only in physical skills but also in wisdom and care. They then step down, passing their responsibilities on and assuming the title of Grandfather (or Grandmother). They remain close at hand for several years, serving as an advisor for the new Parent until they tire and choose to step down fully.</p>
            
            <h3>The Growing of Gabesh</h3>
            <p>Though no one is ceratin in modern days, the phrase “Even Gabesh wasn’t grown in a day” perpetuates. The hometrees of Ospya’s capital city are certainly impressive, and their continual growth to fit the growing population is a testament to their continued vitality. Their origin story is a stunning one, now shared as an old wives tale but once known for the truth it is. </p>
            <p>Over a thousand years ago, Ospya was much less populated than it is now. Despite this, they still needed a capital, and one that could keep them safe from the beasts that prowled the forest floor, creatures both respected and rightfully feared. One druid, his name long lost to time, sat down upon the ground and dug his fingers into the soil. He sent his soul into the earth around them, communing with the seeds and the ground itself. The others were uncertain of exactly what he was doing, but could feel that something was occurring and therefore let him be. THey camped for the night, resting and communing all around him. They set guards to watch overnight, and when they all awoke in the morning this druid was still there, vines and roots not growing up over his hands and legs. The forest seemed a little denser around them, and they did not want to leave this member of their community behind so they stayed another night. This night, the night watch could hear beasts around their encampment, but none came close enough to threaten. Again, the people awoke to their friend silent and unseeing, and chose to remain with him. Some made ventures into the forest to gather food, finding the trees denser than ever and so alive that they could practically hear them speaking to each other. Once again, they all rested, leaving some awake to watch the borders and their friend. Again, beasts were heard but never threatened, and the morning came peacefully. When the people awoke this time, they found the ground to be far less flat than the evening before, the soil raised in random humps and mounds. The children had great fun that day, scrambling over the bumps and sliding down them like some grand, natural playground. Again, a night unthreatened by the beasts they heard, and again, a change in the ground beneath them when they awoke. This time, they found themselves lifted, their tents supported on the strong branches of trees unseen before today. The druid still sat, centred in their camp and supported by branches that formed a chair beneath him. Today the adolescents played too, swinging from the branches down to the ground and chasing each other through the canopy. They set but one guard that night, to watch over their friend and protector. The beasts still growled, but the dense forest surrounding this growing home prevented their entry into this new haven. The next morning, the trunks had opened themselves, growing large enough to hold a child or two, and those children enjoyed this new development with round after round of hide and seek. A restful night, their protector protected by not only how own work but by their community, and a morning of new developments. Now, each tent was carefully placed within the open trunk of a large tree, and their friend was placed inside his own tree, still resting on his seat of branches, small tendrils wrapping around his wrists and ankles, and a single strand of leaves wrapped around his head like a circlet. The other elder members of the group now sat themselves next to him, listening carefully to the trees as they creaked and sang around their little council. Each returned to their tent- their home, now- for the night, once again leaving one careful guard to watch over their protector. When they awoke the next morning in their homes, now even larger than the day before, they heard chatter from the central tree. Not the slow symphony of the trees they had found the day before, but the sound of voices. They ran to their friend, finding him awake and leaning forward to hear the words of a child who had run up to him. The leaves around his head had faded and fallen, leaving a simple wooden circlet behind, and the branches that had held him when on the chair now formed jewellery of a sort, no longer binding him to his work. He looked up as they entered, grinning quickly at them before turning back to the child, answering their excited questions before they ran back outside, shouting to their friends about what they had  been told. The druid looked back at his wise friends, then gestured at the seats that now circled the room. 
            <p>“Sit, my friends. I am sure you have many questions, and I will answer them to the best of my ability.”</p>
            <p>They did all sit, swiftly flooding the room with noise as discussion began. He explained the work he had done by imploring the soil for assistance, then the seeds, and then the water in the ground around them. He had told the earth of their plight and asked for assistance, offering his own energy and power in return. The earth, knowing of his people’s respect and care for the world, agreed to help and began forming this new city, high off the ground to keep them safe from beasts. “The trees live still”, he tells them, “and will continue to do so as long as we care for them and for the world around us. They will grow,”, he continued, gesturing for a pause at those who start to speak, “to fit our people and any we choose to bring into our fold. This will one day be a great city, thriving under the combined hand of nature and of our mortal representative. I will step down as soon as the city- both the people and the trees- deem it ready, and from there we will form a system of government to sustain both. Until that point, I ask you all to be my council- not only to support, but also to restrain. To ensure that any decisions are made for the benefit of the people, and I ask that you continue to serve as best you can throughout the next period of this city’s growth.”</p>
            <p>As he concludes this speech, he looks around at the individuals around him and each nods, accepting the blessing and burden of such an appointment. This became the basis for the governmental system of Gabesh, with the leader and council watching over the city and presenting ideas to the people, giving each citizen a vote in what happens within their city.</p>

            <h2>Individuals’ Stories </h2>
            
            <h3>FRIRSE</h3>
            <p> Frirse is the High Cleric of the main temple of Light and Void in Edrana. They are a magma dragonborn, and as such do not leave the temple often, as they are the only one on the planet and get a lot of attention anytime they are seen.</p>
            <p>This attention is actually what drove them to religion in the first place. Having grown up in a simple town in Edrana, they originally thought little of their differences from the others around them. Sure, some of the other children made fun of them, but they did that to all the children who were any different from them. They realised just how rare they were in their early teens, when word somehow got out and visitors started coming more and more often to their little town, sometimes even chasing them through the streets or finding them at their home to stare in through the windows. One day, Frirse saw a group of people walking up the road, looking around as if in search of something– or someone. The poor teenager looked around desperately for somewhere to hide and saw the small temple of the Blue in their town, then moved towards it in hopes of sanctuary. The priest there smiled warmly at them and, seeing their frantic look, led them to the back of the temple where a small alcove lay, divided by a curtain from the main room. They sat gratefully, thanking the priest for his help. Unfortunately, as the curtain fell Frirse saw the group step into the temple and greet the priest, speaking as if they were on some sort of pilgrimage. The group ended up staying for some time, praying and pondering upon their desires (and begging the Blue for a glimpse of the elusive dragonborn they were actually in town to see, utterly unaware of that very individual’s presence not 20 feet from them.) While waiting for the group to leave, Frirse took a look around the alcove they were hidden in. They found shelves of books lining one wall and a gorgeous mural on the other, depicting the Chromaston. This was a known image to them, but there was extra detail placed on what they always thought was just a background. Looking closer, they realised that it was actually depictions of Light and Void, more clearly depicted than they had ever seen before. With that, they turned around to look at the books and found tomes of religious history and theory, all about Light and Void. Pulling down what seemed to be the most basic, they sat down to read. </p>
            <p>They became so immersed in the tome that they missed the group leaving, the several other genuine worshippers, and the priest’s cleaning at the end of the night. Eventually the priest poked his head into the alcove to alert Frirse that he was leaving and they had to as well for safety. Seeing their place in the book- already most of the way through- he invited them to take it with them and complete it, then to bring it back the next day and chat with him about what they had learned. They accepted enthusiastically, and did so the next day. The priest, along with being a follower of the Blue, was a scholar of Light and Void who collected information and was more than happy to share it. He became a huge part of Frirse’s life after this, leading them to eventually become a cleric themselves and eventually take their role as the head cleric of the temple of Light and Void. </p>
            <p>They are also the first person Dinui saw upon awakening in the temple.</p> 

            <h3>MIRYAM</h3>
            <h4>Her Story: </h4>
            <p>“I don’t remember much of my childhood honestly, but who does? All I’ve ever really known is Dad and the temple in [halfling village]. I grew up there, learning about and from the Blue. I’m not a halfling, myself, but I love my people and I felt so out of place when I started getting so tall. When I was about 13 I asked the Blue for some way to fit in better, and they gave me an illusion spell, so now I have a presentation more comfortable for home. It's basically just instinct now, I don’t even choose to set it anymore. So obviously, I’ve got some gifted powers from the Blue. I think I might be a cleric like Dad, but maybe I’m a paladin or something! I haven’t really worried about specific labels, I just like the opportunity to learn and help people.</p>
            <p>The past half a dozen years, I’ve started helping with monster and Duskad attacks-mostly just healing and helping behind the scenes, but last time I actually had something new happen! I was hurt and couldn’t run, but there was this huge direwolf running towards me and so I just screwed up my eyes and put my hand out and prayed real hard- it worked! I didn’t see exactly what happened, but the wolf was suddenly limping away from me, some sort of shimmer on its hurt leg and a faint trace on my hand too.</p>
            <p>Other fun facts about me? Hmm. I don’t really get hungry or tired, which is interesting- Dad got so worried when I started forgetting to eat though, so I’ve tried really hard to make a habit of eating a proper amount no matter if I’m hungry or not. I also don’t seem to need as much sleep as other people, which is handy when I’m focused on a project! My dreams are always pretty vivid, though similar- I always have a long conversation with a being that feels so familiar, almost like family.”</p>
            <h4>The Real Story </h4>
            <p>”“Aaron! Take your sister and run!”</p>
            <p>Mama is wrapping up our baby brother and putting him in a basket- I helped make that basket- and Aaron is pulling on my hand, trying to get me to go to the back door. </p>
            <p>“Come on, Miryam, we have to get out of here!” He keeps pulling, and my elbow hurts, so I try to get away from him but he won’t let go.</p>
            <p>“Mama? Aren’t you coming with us?” She looks up, and I don’t recognise the look on her face but I don’t think it’s good. I can barely hear her response over the pounding at the door- isn’t somebody going to answer that?</p>
            <p>“Yes, honey, Daddy and I will catch up with you. Go with your brother, okay? Run as fast as you can and I’ll promise I’ll find you once it’s not dangerous anymore.” </p>
            <p>If she promised, it has to be true, right? </p>
            <p>I run out the back door with Aaron, and he’s got the same look on his face as Mama. Usually he’s faster than me when we race, but today he’s running right beside me, not letting go of my hand. I look behind me and I can barely see Mama running out the back door too, holding our basket with my brother in it and running the other way. I almost want to yell to her, to tell her she’s going the wrong way, but Aaron squishes my hand even tighter and tells me not to make too much noise. </p>
            <p>It starts hurting when I breathe, but Aaron won’t stop running. I try to slow down but he tells me that we have to keep going, that we haven’t gotten far enough away yet. </p>
            <p>I try, and I keep going, but Aaron gets even more scared when he hears noises coming from behind us. </p>
            <p>“What if it’s Mama and Daddy? We should wait for them.”</p>
            <p>“It’s not, Miryam. We have to keep going.”</p>
            <p>“But-”</p>
            <p>“It’s not them! The people chasing us are going to hurt us if they catch up. We have to keep going.”</p>
            <p>The trees around us keep getting taller, and it’s so dark that I can hardly see the path in front of us. One of the moons is so thin above us, and only sometimes peeks out from behind the leaves. The thudding noises behind us get louder, and I can suddenly tell that there are way more people than I thought. It’s definitely not Mama and Daddy, and Aaron knows it too. He lets go of my hand, and I almost fall over as he pushes me ahead of him. Something falls next to me, and when I look over I can see an arrow stuck in the ground beside me. Aaron slows down and starts to turn as I feel something hit me, then watch as another arrow hits him too. </p>
            <p>“Keep running, Miryam! Keep following the star!”, as he gestures towards the sky, “I’ll distract them so you can get away, and I’ll come get you when it’s safe, okay?” </p>
            <p>“Do you promise?”</p>
            <p>“Of course I do. Now go!” </p>
            <p>So I do, even though arrows keep cutting past me and I can hear Aaron yelling. </p>
            <p>The moon keeps getting higher and my shoes are too thin. Every rock hurts when I step on them, but the thought of Aaron’s face as he turned around makes sure I don’t stop. </p>
            <p>I do slow down though, as the night gets darker. The trees are thick enough now that I have to walk slowly to make sure I don’t run into anything, and I still can’t breathe all the way. </p>
            <p>I’m not sure if my eyes are closing or not, because it’s so dark here that it looks the same either way. I don’t even know if I’m going the right way or not, since I can’t see the stars anymore. I feel something hard suddenly against my ankle, and I trip over it and end up on the ground. The dirt is cold against my face and I’m so tired that I just stay there, tears falling down my cheeks as I lay over the roots and leaves covering the ground. </p>
            <p>After a while, I try to stand but my legs won’t move like I want them to. I can roll over though, away from the root that was digging into my stomach. I lean up against a tree and rest my head against the bark. The rough texture catches on my hair but I’m too tired to care, and my eyes drift shut again- when did they even open?- as I feel something warm wrap around all the scratches from the arrows and branches I ran into. </p>
            <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
            <p>The space is comfortably warm and a soft shade of grey. It’s not exactly a room, since there are no walls, but it still seems contained by the fog, blocking out the horizons unseen.</p>
            <p><i>She’s so young, Legend. We can’t let her wallow here, especially when she’s so easily helped. She leaned against our tree, after all!</i> The feminine voice isn’t heard so much as felt, and seems to emanate from both everywhere and right beside one’s ear.</p>
            <p><i>I know, Lore. I’m simply concerned for her if she does live, how she’ll deal with what she knows and what she’s lost.</i> A more masculine voice this time, again from everywhere and yet also the opposite side from Lore.</p>
            <p><i>That may be up to her. Offer her choices, if you care to, let her decide what she wishes for her own life.</i> Lore looks over at their brother, making sure Legend is paying attention as they speak. </p>
            <p><i>Like you are? What choice are you presenting to her?</i>, Legend replies, staring down their sister over their hand, held tightly around Lore’s. </p>
            <p><i>I am giving her life. Long enough for you to offer your opportunities. If she wants to keep my gift, so be it. If not, I will release her gently and provide an escort to Violet’s domain. She’s waking up now, Legend. Either speak to her or step back so that I can.</i> Lore steps towards where Miryam lays, the grey fogginess clearing enough to make them visible to the child. Their clothing is dark and warm, thick fabrics and soft furs enveloping their shape as they kneel down beside her. Their hand is still stretched back, hidden in the fog and still grasping Legend’s fingers. </p>
            <p>“Hello, Miryam.”</p>
            <p>“You know my name?” Her voice is unexpectedly loud in the space, higher pitched than either of the other beings, and she wipes away the tears from her face as she looks up. </p>
            <p>“Of course we do. And you know ours too, though you may not recognise us yet.” Legend steps forward as they speak, standing tall next to their sister. Their broad form is wrapped in gauzy material quite unlike Lore’s warm clothing, and they are pale save for their dark eyes. “We are the Blue. This is my sister, Lore, and I am Legend.”</p>
            <p>Lore smiles as they are introduced, their white-fogged eyes bright against their dark skin. “It’s good to meet you more clearly, Miryam. We are quite close to your parents- you’ve heard them pray with us quite often- and we have heard so much about you and your brothers.”</p>
            <p>Miryam quickly gets up from where she had been laying, her knees thudding against the ground as she kneels and bows her head. “Oh! I’m so sorry, Blue, I didn’t know, I am- oh how did Mama say it- I am truly…humbled! Humbled to be in your presence!”</p>
            <p>Lore smiles before speaking, reaching out their hand towards Miryam. “No need for such ceremony, dear. Here, can you stand?” </p>
            <p>Miryam takes the outstretched hand and does so, looking up at the faces of the deities above her. “Where am I, anyways? I thought I was in the forest still, and Aaron was going to come find me and then Mama and Daddy were going to come find me and…this doesn’t look like a forest.” Legend and Lore look at each other at this, then Legend sighs and kneels down to be closer to her level. </p>
            <p>“I’m afraid I don’t have very good news for you, Miryam. You’re safe for now, though quite hurt, but your family is not quite so safe. Your parents did not get away from the raiding party, and Aaron is very hurt right now. We don’t know if he will survive either.” Tears have started rolling down her cheeks again, and this time she doesn’t wipe them away. Lore gently pulls her in and she goes willingly into the embrace of their warm arm. </p>
            <p>“I’m so sorry we couldn’t do anything for them. It was their fate, and there was no one near them to change that. Your fate has yet to be decided, however.” Miryam leans back at this, looking up at the dark face above her. </p>
            <p>It is Legend, though, who continues. “You have an opportunity, child. You can choose to join your family now, to leave this world and life behind as it is. Your other option, however, is this: you may stay longer and be given power to improve the world and change fates.”</p>
            <p>Miryam had seemed about to agree to the first option, but as she hears the final words- <i>change fate</i>- her face shifts. “That one. I want to change fates. To help people.”</p>
            <p>“It will be hard”, says the feminine voice above her, “and it may take a long time to see your family again.”</p>
            <p>“But I’ll still see them?” At a nod from both Legend and Lore, she continues. “Then I want to stay.”</p>
            <p>“Another thing before you decide. There is something else that must be discussed.” Miryam turns at the sound of the masculine voice, looking up to see Legend looking intently down at her. “Balance must be maintained. Something must be given to receive this power. I do have an idea, something that may help you live a happier life until your final time comes.” At Miryam’s curious look, he continues. “I propose that we hold your memories for you. That can be your trade, and not remembering all this sadness may help you to focus better on helping others.” </p>
            <p>A strange, conflicted expression comes across her face, and she thinks for a moment before nodding stiffly. “As long as I get them back when I am done.” </p>
            <p>“Of course.” </p>
            <p>With the agreement made, Lore reaches up to take Legend’s other hand, making a ring around Miryam. She wipes away the tears on her face, looking down at her hands with surprise at the colour now coating her skin. One hand is covered in tears of white, shimmering brightly against her brown skin, and the other deep black tears, leaving dark trails where the tears fell. She feels a soft kiss on the top of her head as Lore leans down, then a warmth rolling through her body as she returns to the forest, a faint whisper echoing as she leaves.</p>
            <p><i>Say hello to Jethro for us!</i></p>
            <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
            <p>The tree is warm behind me as I wake up, and the rising sun is just barely visible through the leaves. There’s a soft rustling on the other side of the tree, and as I turn around to look, some roots pull away from where they were wrapped around me. </p>
            <p>Huh.</p>
            <p>A halfling is kneeling on the ground and looking up at the tree, his blue priest’s robes puddled around him on the fallen leaves. He sees me as I move, and jumps a little at my appearance. </p>
            <p>“Oh! Hello?”</p>
            <p>“Hi! I’m….” I trail off as I try to remember, and he looks at me with his head slightly cocked.</p>
            <p>Miryam, something whispers</p>
            <p>“I’m Miryam, I guess”</p>
            <p>“I’m Father Jethro. It’s nice to meet you, Miryam.”</p>
            <p>Jethro? There’s something about that name, and before I can even think it through, words are already tumbling from my mouth. </p>
            <p>“TheBluesayshello” </p>
            <p>“What?”</p>
            <p>“What?” I can’t even remember what I said, much less why I might have done so. </p>
            <p>With a confused look, he sits down next to me and glances over me, and for the first time I do too. Roots are wrapped loosely around my legs and stomach, but when I move they fall away. I have no idea what’s happening, so I just sit and stare at the tree-the sky- anything but myself or this stranger. </p>
            <p>Father Jethro still looks confused, but he doesn’t ask any more questions. Instead, he starts to talk about the tree that we’re leaning against. Apparently it’s one of the Blue’s trees, and usually nobody can find it unless they’re church people. After a while, I feel comfortable enough to start responding and asking questions, and everything I learn feels right, somehow. </p>
            <h4>Basic Information</h4>
            <p>She’s human, but has her Mask of Many Faces on almost 24/7, so much that it’s an instinct more than choice now. She looks like a halfling. </p>
            <p>She’s also a warlock, but she thinks she’s a cleric or paladin. </p>
            <p>30 y/o</p>
            <p>She was born to a human family in a small village on the fringes of a forest. At the age of 7, her community was attacked and her parents forced her to run, to leave them behind. Her baby sibling was placed carefully in a basket and sent down the river, while her older brother Aaron ran the opposite direction from her, hoping that at least one of them might survive. Miryam ran and ran, eventually collapsing against a tree to curl up and rest a little. She could barely even cry, but her whole world had just crumbled before her eyes. She sat at the roots of that tree for hours, just staring into nothing, until a halfling in religious garb-Jethro- walked to the tree. He saw her after reaching the trunk (she was sitting on the opposite side from his path) and glanced up through the branches before walking around the tree to check on her. What Miryam did not know was that this tree- under which she had sat without any specific reason- was actually consecrated to and blessed by the Blue. He was coming to visit for his daily devotion, and when he saw her, he knew that this was his mission sent from the Blue. He sat down next to her and started to talk. He told her all about the tree, how it had come to this spot and what it meant. He told her about the Blue and their powers/role, and how he came to be a follower of the Blue. She started to slowly listen and perk up, eventually starting to respond and ask questions. He took her home with him and provided food, a bed, and warmth. </p>
            <p>What he was soon to learn he did not expect. As Miryam sat in front of the fire and recovered, she never warmed. Her wounds had closed, but no pulse ever thrummed through her veins. The roots where she had sat for so long had changed (unnoticed by Jethro) to curve around Miryam, covering her wounds (arrows and burns from the attack). The blood had run from her veins and was drunk by the tree, and as her head rested against the tree, her mind connected with it. As she sat there, she communicated with the Blue and made her promise- a contract created by the Blue to help Miryam. Legend offered powers in trade for her traumatic memories, and Miryam took the offer. Her first memory now (the conversation with the Blue was also scrubbed) is slowly coming to consciousness and hearing Jethro talking about the Blue and feeling like that was right. (The tree above the soil is of Legend and gave her powers in trade for her memory, but underneath, like a mirror, is another tree-that of Lore-hidden beneath the earth. This tree was the one that wrapped and healed her with roots, and gave her life (though an undead one) in exchange for the blood. {She would have lost it anyways, as there was no one to heal her, so Lore did what they could to help her.}</p>
            <p>Jethro never asked her about her past. Whether it’s a lack of curiosity, a knowledge of the trauma she must have undergone, or some prompting from the Blue, no one knows. Not even Jethro. Miryam just doesn’t think about it. </p>
            <p>As time passed, she became more comfortable in the halfling community and began to follow her adopted father in his worship of the Blue. She began to show signs of some magic, and Jethro encouraged her connection to the Blue and her practising. The first proper spell she picked up was one of illusion (mask of many faces), and she created an illusory halfling form to more easily participate in her new community (especially since she was ~13 here, and was getting to be much taller than her friends). She has kept it on every day since then, and hardly even remembers what her physical body looks like anymore. </p>
            <p>She has spent most of her time with her dad in the temple now, though sometimes she will help in emergency situations. The most recent attack on the village was dire wolves, and she was almost taken by one. She had fallen-one leg hurt beneath her- and thrust out her hand between her and the threatening beast, no plan or hope, and was surprised by the tingle in her fingers and the sudden yelp of the creature. (golden light shot from her palm- almost from the veins of her wrist- and hit the direwolf) When she opened her eyes, she saw it limping away and a faint golden shimmer left on the injured leg. (eldritch blast)</p>
            <p>Her nightly dreams are filled with communion with the Void.</p>
            <p>Undead (intelligent)</p>
            <p>Damage resistances: cold, poison</p>
            <p>Damage immunities: necrotic</p>
            <p>Conditions immunities: poisoned, sleep, disease</p>
            <p>Partial Vulnerabilities: radiant (+50%)</p>
            <p>Vision: darkvision 60 ft</p>
            <p>Undead do not eat, sleep, or breathe- Instead of sleep, they may undertake a 4 hour period of communion with the Void in order to rest and heal.</p>

            <h3>JESHUA</h3>
            <p>Little is known about Jeshua before his adoption by the Family. His new parents- Dagik’s blood aunt and uncle- found him as an infant in a basket, washed up on the banks of a river they were visiting. They raised him as their own along with their other children. They never let anyone treat him differently, but they never lied to him about his origins either. He knew he was not their blood child, but knew just as well that they were his parents because they loved him and he loved them.</p>
            <p> His parents have since passed away–thus is the risk of being crucial members of a worldwide crime family– but he learned a great deal from them and from all the others in the Family. When Dagik began taking missions to prove himself suitable as the next Father, Jeshua was one of his first choices for his strike team. They worked well together, completing missions and escaping notice until Dagik had finally earned his place, after which he swiftly gave Jeshua a role of his own- Uncle of Trouveh, Duskad, which gave him jurisdiction not only over Trouveh but influence over the entire country. Jeshua has since grown older and more frail as an inescapable disease ravages his body, but he still serves his Family with everything he has. Though holed up in his home, he still drafts communications, meets with new members, and researches information essential to his Cousins’ missions. </p>

            <h3>DINUI</h3>
            <p>Dinui Outis was taken in by the temple of Light and Void in Edrana at a young age after her parents disappeared- she still doesn’t know what happened to cause them to leave, but she tries not to think about it. As an adult (30), she now works as an adventurer and bodyguard-for-hire to fund the care of the temple's orphans to help repay the temple’s kindness to her.  However, tragedy struck during a difficult mission she went on with some other adventurers associated with Light and Void. </p>
            <p>Dinui woke in the temple with no memory of who she was or what she was doing. The priests and priestesses who raised her were able to fill in some of the gaps, but with so little knowledge, she felt the need to embark on a quest to find out what happened to her. For some reason she feels most comfortable in her armor, and is seldom seen without it.</p>
            <p>Luckily, Dinui has always been a meticulous note-taker and her contacts, both upstanding and not so upstanding, are all listed in a small notebook that she always keeps with her. The priests at the temple, along with the people she’s met since, have been able to fill her in on what’s been going on lately. </p>
            <p>After another bodyguarding job she took in order to visit Contrarsi (known to be the largest library in the world) but having no luck, she returned to the temple to pore over the library there once more. As she was running her hand along a shelf, a small book caught her attention…</p>

            <h3>MBAH KABEYA</h3>
            <p>”soldier, poet, king”</p>
            <p>After his sibling died and he was unable to save them, Kabeya joined a group of soldiers young, his large frame helping his lie of maturity. Kabeya was so afraid of being useless that he trained constantly, getting stronger until he could beat nigh any enemy that came against him, using a combination of the magic he learned from his parents and his own brute strength.</p>
            <p>Conflicts began to be solved peacefully, leaving the cocky Kabeya with no war to fight. He fell into fighting pits in order to work out his discontent, but one day was beaten so badly that he had to spend multiple months recovering. Due to this event, Kabeya saw (despite his best efforts otherwise) that he could not continue on this path of brute strength and nothing more. As he recuperated, he began to research and learn, finally starting to understand the forces behind not only his own magic, but also the political intrigues behind the battles he had been fighting these last years. In this understanding he also found interest and satisfaction- the opportunity to help even more people than he did with his fists.</p>
            <p>Mbah began writing. After a few years, his words had flooded Ospya and a huge percentage of the population had read and appreciated his thoughts on everything from battle to magic to even interpersonal relationships, something he had needed to practise as he depended on others during his recuperation. Books, pamphlets, any bookstore was sure to have at least a little something written by or contributed to by him.</p>
            <p>After about a century of research, writing, and recuperation, Mbah Kabeya began to walk the streets of Gabesh again. After so much time hidden away to heal, he was glad to see the sky and spent every night stargazing, watching them shimmer and hearing the starsong. He spent so much time in tune with the celestial lights that his mortal eyes failed, and he now instead sees by the stars themselves, a grand ‘birds eye view’ that he has trained and focused to be able to use.</p>
            <p>When the Elections were coming around, Mbah Kabeya would never have thought to join the list of possibilities. It wasn’t until three separate people, completely unprompted, mentioned that they thought he would be a good governmental figure that he even considered it as a possibility. He was not ready for that election, but five years later when it was time to elect again, he was ready to begin his campaign. He didn’t do much (wanting his merits to shine rather than any showboating), but nevertheless won in a landslide vote. He has now been the democratic leader of Ospya for 4 years (he would never think it, but an omniscient being [me] knows that he’s definitely being voted in for a second term) and has done good work for the country, helped on by his many experiences and great research.</p>
