            <h2>Countries</h2>
            
            <h3>Aclus</h3>
            <p>Capital City: Contrarsi</p>
            <p>Governing System: Representative Democracy</p>
            <p>Aclus has a huge population of scholars and artisans, so Contrarsi is basically one huge library. Every citizen’s front room has shelves filled with books, tools, and art. Everyone is willing to lend, and everyone knows the importance of trust in the academic world. Shared knowledge is so essential that if anyone is found to be taking advantage of this system, they are removed from the city and not allowed to return without mounds of paperwork and multiple courses. It’s very rare that anyone returns. Aclus is also the main country where the monks live/train, with a headquarters in Contrarsi but smaller branches spread across the country, then even fewer spread across the world.</p>
            <p>Aclus is mostly plains biome, meaning it is the 'bread basket' of the Blue, growing a large portion of the grains and other plants required.</p> 
            <p>The location of highest importance is the Study Room, where the rarest and the most dangerous texts are held. Anyone is technically allowed to visit, but to be admitted and have access to the books, citizens must complete a long set of courses on the treatment of such artifacts and multiple humanities courses in order to prevent damage to the texts and to dissuade usage of the extremely powerful magics contained in that room. For the books that are mundane, but very rare, there are copies of the words published so people can read them without needing to undergo the courses, it is just the specific rare publications that require extra preparation.</p>
            
            <h3>Duskad</h3>
            <p>Capital city: Trouveh</p>
            <p>Governing System: Monarchy</p>
            <p>Duskad at odds with Edrana for resources- they could get along if they had peace talks, but every time they’ve tried, something has gone wrong. Whether it’s one of the leaders choosing not to parley, a natural disaster at the intended meeting place, or some other chaos, nothing ever works. Their main trade is carving/boatmaking/other wood products, so they always need wood, which is sourced mostly from Edrana. The land used to be one large mass, but when the Divide happened, an impact shattered the continent.</p>
            <p>Duskad is mostly water biome, varying between bogs/swamps, cities filled with canals instead of roads, and small islands scattered into the ocean. As you head inland, the water slowly transitions from the salt of the ocean water to fresh, meaning that many islands near the ‘coast’ are surrounded by a strange brackish mixture.</p>  
            <p>The most protected location in the country is The Vault, owned by the royal family. It contains not only riches but magical items. One of these is the Crown, which determines the divinely-appointed ruler when it is uncertain and is also used for coronations.</p>
            
            <h3>Edrana</h3>
            <p>Capital city: Verloren</p>
            <p>Governing System: Monarchy</p>
            <p>At odds with Duskad for resources, specifically foodstuffs that are impossible to find in the forests and for population. The two countries could get along if they had peace talks, but every time they’ve tried, something has gone wrong.</p>
            <p>Edrana is mostly composed of a forest biome.</p>
            <p>Securest location is a temple of the Blue, which holds a magical artifact with the same powers as the Crown, but it is much more secret and used with much less frequency.</p>
            
            <h3>Frozen North</h3>
            <p>Capital City: Palna (by default, as it is the only non-dragon settlement.)</p>
            <p>There is no government save for the loose hierarchy of the community, based on experience.</p>
            <p>It’s just what it sounds like: cold, ice, and nothing even remotely resembling hospitality. Palna is about 5 days’ travel from the edge of the country, and they stay pretty solitary.</p>
            
            <h3>Ospya</h3>
            <p> Capital city: Gabesh</p>
            <p>Governing System: Democratic</p>
            <p>The majority of the world’s population considers Ospya to be the strangest due to the high population of druids. While druids do exist in other countries, they are much rarer and therefore have little influence on the government and population as a whole. In Ospya, however, almost everyone is a druid and even those who are not still hold nature in great esteem. The capital is made of giant, hollow trees that form the buildings-- everything from homes to government buildings to stores is built within the bark and branches of these huge trees. It also has a high-speed, vine-based public transit system that has branches spreading through the country to the other major cities.</p>
            <p>All the biomes are represented across the country.</p> 
            <p>The most secure location on Ospya is in Gabesh, where a sealed tree in the main governing building secretly holds items of great importance or danger. </p>
            
            <h2>Oceans</h2> 
            <p>The unclaimed portions of the oceans are split between the countries, jurisdiction depending on which country you are closest to. Due to the presence of dragons in the oceans, however, there is usually little crime past petty things that the individual leaders of communities can handle. The dragons, merpeople, and sea elves each have their large portions of loosely claimed territory, and they each overlaps with the others. Travel does not happen frequently directly across the Ocean, but when it does occur it is with the express permission of the people whose territory is being crossed. </p>
            
            <h2>Time System</h2>
            <p>7 day weeks with 24 hour days. It is described, however, based on the moons rather than weeks or months. A quarter moons phase is equivalent to a week, and since there are two moons, one is always visible (even during the day) to allow knowledge of what phase it is.</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>The Blue are actually two beings in one: Legend and Lore were born as conjoined twins, and when there was an attempt to divide them, the first black hole was created. They were quickly reconnected and the black hole faded, though there is still a scar in space. Children are taught the story of the Blue as part of history class in school.</p>
            <p>The Blue is a creature of opposites and balance. Each twin takes after a parent- so one is of Light, and the other of Void. They use they/them pronouns when together (since they're plural in that case), but even when referring to only one side, they still use they/them pronouns despite the divided gender presentations. Legend is the light side and presents masculinely, and Lore is the void side and presents more femininely. Since the two spend all their time together, often even sharing minds, society's line between genders is nothing to them. They must remain conjoined, but can change their connection point depending on what activities they are doing. If they need use of their hands, for example, they may shift the connection point to their hip or knee so they can stand next to each other and work. For walking, it is usually as though they are holding hands. When sleeping, however, they cannot focus on maintaining a new connection point and therefore share a mind, as they were born. This means that they dream together and, when awake, can share thoughts intentionally so both can consider an issue at once. This mental connection is often chosen when there is something of great power/import that needs completed. </p>
            <p>Obviously the two cannot be split, so they were given a planet to share. They couldn't decide on a singular intelligent species to populate it with, therefore multiple species are present thereon. (For gameplay purposes, this means that any living race may be chosen.)</p>
            <p>There are two moons orbiting this planet- a singular pair of twins succeeded in reaching Yellow's realm and were therefore given moons of their own. As such, the tides move 4x a day, rather than 2x, and there is always a moon in the sky regardless of the time of day (you can only see both on rare occasions at the very lip of dawn or dusk)</p>
            <p>Legend interacts directly most frequently with mortals, but Lore is more often influencing things to help people subtly.</p>

        <button type="button" class="collapsible"> Religion </button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The Blue is known world-wide as the creator of the planet, but worship varies from person to person. Some believe that the Blue influences every moment and decision made, whereas others consider Them to be distant, more overseers than influences. </p>
            <p>There are temples scattered all across the continents, especially concentrated around the Blue's trees, at least one of which is on every continent. These trees are considered to be the closest contact with deity on the planet, so pilgrimages are not uncommon for those who desire closeness with the Blue or have a difficult decision or request to make. The leaves are used as part of some religious practices, but only the higher-level priests are trained how to safely enter this communicative trance.</p>
