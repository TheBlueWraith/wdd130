            <p>Violet created her planet within the embrace of Void, unconcerned by the distance from Light. With such preference, her few creations are themselves half void, spectral upon her lightless planet. As she watched her siblings guard their worlds, however, she wished that she had created something of greater interest. When they all began to wonder what to do with the souls of the lost, she saw her opportunity. She offered her planet as an afterlife, promising that her own creations would guard the spirits until they faded naturally and happily. She and her Seraphim have done so since, watching over these small specks of spiritual light on her planet as they slowly learn to rest amongst the stars. </p>

            <p>She's happy- being further from Light means that she is closer to Void, and she has always been a ‘Daddy's girl’.</p>
