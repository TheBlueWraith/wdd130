   <h2> Myriad Felton </h2>
   <p> Hey y'all, I'm Myriad. I'm an English major and graduate with my Bachelors in December, but I loved the coding I did in my 'tech for professional writers' class so I thought I'd take an official coding class! I'm looking forward to learning more, expanding my skillset, and maybe even finding career opportunities that overlap my love of language and coding.</p>
   <p> I love to read, cook, and play D&D! I'm quite a nerd about many things, in fact, and that might come through in some of my projects. </p> 
   <p> I'm from Texas originally, but I don't really plan to go back once I've graduated. This semester is all about figuring out what my next step is!</p>
   <p> I'm currently going steady with my partner, we've been together for just over 9 months now and it's been fantastic. </p>
   <p> I'm not sure what else to say here, honestly. I'm happy to chat with people, be that about assignments or not! </p>
